Testing Unity multiplayer networking

  I have implemented a simple pong game with two players. One player starts the game as the host and then the other joins as a client. Once 2 players have joined the server the ball starts moving in a random direction. The scoring UI works and adds a point to the correct player when the ball goes past the player. No menu has been implemented yet, but the UI dissapears when the player connects to the server.
